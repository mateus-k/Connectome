# Connectome
A connectome is a comprehensive map of neural connections in the brain

First I downloaded 'the model code and demo files' from the article 'Brain organization into resting state networks emerges from the connectome at criticality. Haimovici et al. (2013) Physical Review Letters' from the personal site of the Prof. Dante R. Chialvo: http://www.chialvo.net/chialvo.net/Publications.html

Then I used the GNU octave (https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) to extract the principal matrixes in a csv format from the matlab file 'Greenberg_Hastings_PRL_2013/Greenberg_Hastings_Model_PRL.m'

In a Jupyter Notebook I uploaded the matrixes in the python language
